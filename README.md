# godirect

A Python module for reading from [Vernier Go DirectÂ® Sensors](https://www.vernier.com/products/sensors/go-direct-sensors/) using USB or BLE.

Take a look at the [godirect-examples repository](https://github.com/VernierST/godirect-examples) for ideas and a number of helpful examples.

## Requirements

The following Python modules are required for `godirect`. They will be installed
automatically as dependencies when installing `godirect` via pip.

* pexpect

The following Python modules are recommended for `godirect`. They will only be installed if they are specified as `extras` when installing `godirect` via pip. See below.

* vernierpygatt (fork of the pygatt project with a fix for the BGAPI on Windows)
* hidapi (USB HID device support)

## Installation

Automatically install the `extras` support dependencies for both USB and BLE.
```bash
pip install godirect[usb,ble]
```

In order to use the native Windows 10 or Linux BLE stack, Bleak must be installed.  To install:
```bash
pip install bleak
```

## Example Use

Connect to the first available USB device or closest BLE device within the default threshold and collect 10 samples from the default sensor.
```python
from godirect import GoDirect
godirect = GoDirect()
device = godirect.get_device()
if device != None and device.open(auto_start=True):
	sensors = device.get_enabled_sensors()
	print("Connected to "+device.name)
	print("Reading 10 measurements")
	for i in range(0,10):
		if device.read():
			for sensor in sensors:
				print(sensor.sensor_description+": "+str(sensor.value))
	device.stop()
	device.close()
godirect.quit()
```

Note that you can choose to enable USB, BLE, or both. By default both will be enabled.
```python
godirect = GoDirect(use_ble=True, use_usb=True)
```

Here is how to obtain a list of GoDirectDevice objects from the BLE and/or USB backends.
```python
# returns a list of GoDirectDevice objects
devices = godirect.list_devices()
```

Or you can let the library automatically find the nearest device for you.
```python
# returns a GoDirectDevice on success or None on failure
mydevice = godirect.get_device()

# to adjust the BLE threshold pass in a minimum dB value
mydevice = godirect.get_device(threshold=-200)
```

Once a device is found or selected it must be opened. By default only information will be 
gathered on Open. To automatically enable the default sensors and start measurements send 
auto_start=True and skip to getting a list of enabled sensors. 
```python
# returns True on success or False on failure
mydevice.open()
```

Once a device is opened you can obtain a list of sensor objects available on
the device.
```python
# returns a list of Sensor objects
sensors = mydevice.list_sensors()
```

Optionally you can select the sensors you want to collect from, otherwise the
default sensor(s) will be used.
```python
# pass a list of sensor numbers to enable
mydevice.enable_sensors([2,3,4])
```

```python
# start measurements at the typical rate for the enabled sensors
mydevice.start() # returns True on success

# start measurements at 1000ms per sample
mydevice.start(period=1000)

# get a list of the GoDirectSensor objects that are enabled
mysensors = mydevice.get_enabled_sensors()
```

The `read()` method will block until data is returned so it is acceptable to read
in a tight loop.

```python
for i in range(0,10):
  # read() will append the measurement received to the values list in the Sensor object
  if mydevice.read():
    for sensor in mysensors:
			print(sensor.value)
```

The `stop()` method will stop data collection on the device. The `close()` method
will disconnect the USB or BLE device. The `quit()` method will stop the USB or BLE backends gracefully.

## Debugging

godirect uses the standard python logging module. You can set the logging verbosity
to INFO or DEBUG to see more communication detail.

```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig()
logging.getLogger('godirect').setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
logging.getLogger('pygatt').setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
```

## Windows

The pygatt module uses the BGAPI backend to communicate with the BLE dongle.
You might have to specify the COM port assigned to the BLE dongle if the auto-detection fails.

```
python
godirect = GoDirect(ble_com_port='COM9')
```

## Linux

In order to communicate with Go Direct devices over USB on Linux systems, you will need to provide a udev rule to grant the proper permissions for the device. You can create such a rule in the proper directory with this command:

```
sudo su -c 'cat <<EOT >/etc/udev/rules.d/vstlibusb.rules
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="08f7", MODE="0666"
SUBSYSTEM=="usb_device", ATTRS{idVendor}=="08f7", MODE="0666"
EOT'
```
